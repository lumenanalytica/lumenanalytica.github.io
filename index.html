      <p>
        At <strong>Lumen Analytica</strong>, we help organizations turn data into smarter decisions. While our company is new,
        our experience runs deep—over 20 years delivering operational excellence across higher education, healthcare,
        supply chain, and service organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We combine real-world expertise with cutting-edge methods in operations, simulation, and machine learning to solve
        complex problems and deliver measurable impact. Our approach blends rigor and practicality: rigorous experimentation
        uncovers insights, and practical strategies ensure they translate into results.
      </p>
      <p>
        We partner with clients to tackle challenges that matter most, transforming data into actionable decisions that
        drive performance and innovation.
      </p>

    <section id="services">
        <h1>Services</h1>
        <p>
          We build the data foundations that power modern decision-making. Our work spans engineering, strategy, and intelligent automation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Connecting data from source to strategy—seamlessly and securely</li>
          <li>Architecting scalable cloud ecosystems across Snowflake, AWS, GCP, and Azure</li>
          <li>Transforming experimentation into measurable machine learning outcomes</li>
          <li>Optimizing operations through data-driven modeling and applied research</li>
          <li>Embedding automation to make analytics faster, smarter, and repeatable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Every engagement aligns architecture with purpose—bridging technology, process, and insight to create lasting value.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="regulatory">
      <h1>Regulatory & Compliance</h1>
      <p>
        In data-driven organizations, trust is earned through compliance. We help clients navigate data protection and
        regulatory responsibility with clarity and confidence. Whether aligning with HIPAA, FERPA, GDPR, or SOC 2, our
        approach embeds compliance into the fabric of architecture and operations—so it strengthens innovation rather than
        constrains it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We translate complex requirements into practical controls, ensuring governance, security, and transparency work
        together seamlessly. Our frameworks emphasize proactive compliance—anticipating change, reducing risk, and maintaining trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a world where data moves faster than policy, compliance is more than a checklist—it’s a mindset that protects
        both data and the people it represents.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="governance">
      <h1>Governance</h1>
      <p>
        Strong governance turns data from a byproduct into a strategic asset. We view governance not as bureaucracy, but
        as the quiet architecture that gives organizations confidence in every decision they make. It’s about protecting
        trust—ensuring data is accurate, consistent, and available when it’s needed most.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether data lives in the cloud, on-premises, or across hybrid environments, we design frameworks that anticipate
        disruption and preserve continuity. Redundancy and recovery aren’t afterthoughts—they’re built in from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
        True governance is less about control and more about stewardship. It balances innovation with responsibility,
        ensuring that as technology evolves, data remains dependable, secure, and aligned with mission and purpose.
